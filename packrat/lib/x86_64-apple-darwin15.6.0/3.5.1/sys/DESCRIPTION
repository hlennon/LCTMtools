Description: Drop-in replacements for the base system2() function with fine control
    and consistent behavior across platforms. Supports clean interruption, timeout, 
    background tasks, and streaming STDIN / STDOUT / STDERR over binary or text 
    connections. Arguments on Windows automatically get encoded and quoted to work on different 
    locales. On Unix platforms the package also provides functions for evaluating 
    expressions inside a temporary fork. Such evaluations have no side effects on the
    main R process, and support reliable interrupts and timeouts. This provides the
    basis for a sandboxing mechanism.
